Applied Predictive Analytics

The module "Applied Predictive Analytics" SS18/19 Humboldt University of Berlin allows students to work on a real-life predictive modeling project with contemporary software packages for data science. 
Students can develop advanced forecasting models using a variety of algorithms from statistics, machine learning, and other domains, while 
advancing their knowledge in data integration, preparation, and transformation, which allows them to create predictive variables from noisy real-world data sets.

In our project "Microfinance Policies: Impact of Microfinance on The Social Well-being", we pursued to measure the effect of a microcredit program in Andhra Pradesh, India.

## Abstract
Is microcredit a miracle or just a hype? While more and more researches were conducted to study microcredits, 
people started to question the effectiveness of microcredit program. This project explores the heterogeneity of treatment effect on
microcredit to householdsâ€™ well-being. Causal Random Forest and Two-model approach are used to analyze treatment effects on the household level
and identify the important variables that separate households with higher treatment effect.
The results show evidence of heterogeneity of the conditional treatment effect on certain aspects of well-being. 
In addition, policy suggestions are proposed to attempt to increase the performance of microfinance program.
